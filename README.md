EHR is electronic health record.
Till now most of the hospitals use it but the records of patients are not shared across other hospitals i.e. its not interoperable and as we all know the owner of data is patient but according to above scenario the hospital(s) own patient's data.

why blockchain based ehr?
* it will solve interoperability issue.
* patient will have control over their data.
* it will solve poor penmenship.
* reserchers will get anonymous patient data for their research.hence, improving the results of research studies as they will hvae more data to test or research on.
* automating the insurance work.
